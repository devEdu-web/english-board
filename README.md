# English-board

Firstly, this is not a project to help study English, it does not provide any kind of support for this and this is why there is no option to add the meaning of a word or expression.

The English Board is a web app to help those who like to keep track of their studies. With this app you can add the words you've studied, how many hours you've listened to English content and it provides a Dashboard to make it easier to follow your progress.


## What did I learn?
This was a relatively big project for me, so obviously I learned a lot about database, authentication flow and validation. But the thing I would like to highlight is images management! I was able to learn the best ways to store images and why they shouldn't be inside of a database. 

## Techs
1. Express;
2. MongoDB
3. Cloudinary 
4. EJS

## Remarks
Personally it was great building this project. Its evolution was astonishing since I first started developing when I was starting to learn programming. It was a two-page project connected to Firebase that would only runs in my machine.  Wish I had the screenshots to make a comparison!
